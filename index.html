    <p>Skateistan: The Tale of Skateboarding in Afghanistan shares the strange
      and beautiful intersection of traditional Afghan society and a new 
      generation of Afghan skateboarders and artists. It features the 
      innovative Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) 'Skateistan', which since
      2007 has taught skateboarding and creative arts to girls and boys in
      Kabul, Afghanistan.</p>
    <p>Skateistan's opening of the country's first skatepark – and focus on 
      working with Afghan girls and streetworking youth – has been covered by
      major media outlets worldwide, including CNN, BBC, Al-Jazeera, and the 
      New York Times. Skateistan: The Tale of Skateboarding in Afghanistan is
      the very first book about the subject and gives a rare, in-depth look
      into the lives of exceptional young Afghans facing incredible challenges
      in a city that is torn by war, but also full of life.</p>
    <p>This 320-page color book features stunning, previously unpublished 
      photographs accompanied by essays, interviews and personal stories from
      Skateistan's founder Oliver Percovich and the young Afghans that have gone
      from being students to teachers in the skatepark and classrooms. Full of
      hope, beauty, gritty honesty – and skateboards! – this is a story about
      Afghanistan that you won’t find anywhere else.</p>
